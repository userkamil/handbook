# Technical Career

You start as a coder or sysadmin, working on small, well defined and isolated tasks. Then you immediately need to become an engineer that gets loosely defined problems/features and creates solutions for them. You need to do this because we are not a development agency and most of our work does not come from some outside specification, but from problems we and our customers discover day-to-day. 

The top two positions are two branches of the technical career:
* Lead Engineer means you start taking over managerial tasks and leading people.
* Principal Engineer means you take ownership of all of technical nitty-gritty details in the company. 

## Junior Programmer / Sysadmin

* Work is thoroughly reviewed with substantial back and forth frequently needed before merging.
* Basic language/technology features are mastered, but some advanced approaches may still be unfamiliar.
* Occasional issues following patterns and approaches within existing code bases.
* Works mostly on clearly defined and scoped individual features or problems.
* Usually less than 2 years of technical experience.


## Junior Software/DevOps Engineer

* Work doesn't necessarily need to be reviewed, but general approach may be.
* Follows established patterns and approaches within existing code bases with ease.
* Is able to work on problems and features that are not clearly defined. Comes up with some specifications and API designs on their own.
* Is able to take a problem all the way from research, writing a User Story through implementation and deployment.
* Can keep production systems online while their colleagues are on vacation.
* Usually at least 2-5 years of engineering experience.

## Software/DevOps Engineer

* Work happens completely autonomously with no regular need for review.
* Fully capable of taking substantial features from concept to shipping as the sole engineer.
* Can provide material feedback on the work of Junior Engineers.
* Helps with hiring and onboarding.

* Capable of running and directing whole teams for large, long-running projects.
* Sets and maintains professional standards for the entire organization.
* Deep, substantial expertise in multiple programming environments.
* Usually at least 8-12 years of engineering experience.

## Principal Engineer

* AKA Steve Wozniak at Apple.

* Regularly saves our asses.
* Fully capable of designing, owning, and running entirely new, novel systems.
* Recognized widely in the industry for material contributions to the state of the art.
